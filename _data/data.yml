        tagline: "Bornomala Symmetric Key (BSK) stream cipher is a developed cipher that generated
        a pair of sub-keys from an input key through a complex key generation technique used in
        encryption. The slightest change in the input symmetric key produces an entirely different
        key pair. Hence, different encrypted results exhibit the reliability of the cipher along
        with modern cryptography. <br> Language: C++ | Development Tools: DevC++ | Time Periods: November, 2020"

        tagline: "RSA is a widely used asymmetric cipher that requires two large random prime numbers
        to generate a public key and a private key to produce ciphertext. This program makes the
        algorithm workable within any range of prime numbers. So the user of this system can
        experiment with any inputs. <br> Language: Python | Development Tools: PyCharm | Time Periods: December, 2020 "
